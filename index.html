		Move around the world with the arrow keys. Press D to toggle debug info. Press H to kill/resurrect your

		There are four different biomes to explore, differentiated by their background color and wall
		characteristics. It is possible to get stuck in small corridors, as well as to spawn inside of a large
		wall; I did not have time to address these issues completely.
		<br><br>
		I've always been fascinated by terrain generation in video games. Three games in particular -
		Minecraft, Terraria and Civilization V - showed me the possibilities that emerge when game worlds
		are generated procedurally rather than hard-coded, and these games inspired me to use generative terrain
		in a project of my own. My goal was to generate simple 2D worlds composed of walls and open spaces
		for the player to explore, with several distinct biomes, and while the difficulties I encountered
		in implementing this in a JavaScript context took up most of my time, the end result is more or
		less in line with my expectations.
