		I've always been fascinated by terrain generation in viedo games. Three games in particular -
		Minecraft, Terraria and Civilization V - showed me the possibilities that emerge when game worlds
		are generated procedurally rather than hard-coded, and this inspired me to use these techniques
		in a project of my own. My goal was to generate simple 2D worlds composed of walls and open spaces
		for the player to explore, with several distinct biomes, and while the difficulties I encountered
		in implementing this in a JavaScript context took up most of my time, the end result is more or
		less in line with my expectations.

		Move around the world with the arrow keys. There are four different biomes to explore,
		differentiated by their background color and wall characteristics.
